BALink React exercise 

## Building the app

`npm install`
`npm run build`

(I did not make the webpack config for production build...)

## Running the server

`node server.js`

then, you can navigate to _localhost:5000_

Tested on Chrome

## TODO

- I didnt know what to do with the Tabs :) 
- Preload the GET request (in order to speed up the rendering)
- clean up the packages!!
- test on other browsers / devices
